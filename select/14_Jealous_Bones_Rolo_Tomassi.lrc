[00:00.42] I want to fill your pores
[00:02.93] Because i've sussed what they seep
[00:06.48] Tired of tales
[00:08.05] Something to find to hide behind
[00:12.44] Hide between the lines
[00:15.80] Zipped lips and bitten tongues
[00:18.90] Scrawled vowels bitterly twisted
[00:21.72] Non verbal sounds
[00:30.22] 
[00:24.38] Secrecy slurs your speeches
[01:25.25] Loyalties lie between these lines
[01:30.02] Keep your eyes peeled for what's real
[01:33.91] It's obsessive it's compulsive
