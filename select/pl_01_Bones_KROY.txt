We spend our days
drinking flowers
We spend the sun kissing
like teenagers
But I found bones
on my doorstep
I don't know
what it's supposed to mean
Reminded me of something
you said
Last summer
under the clover tree
But
When the moon arrives
When the moon arrives
When the moon arrives
You stroke my hair
and say goodnight
Where there was in
kon my fingers
Now there is blood on my hands
Don't tell me
that it gets better
I never did understand
Cause
When the moon arrives
When the moon arrives
When the moon arrives
You stroke my hair
and say goodnight
I wish that
When the moon would arrive
If the moon arrived
When the moon would arrive
You'd kiss my lips
and stay the night
