They're loading up the ships
They're loading up the planes
There's madness in the sky
Above the bones of saints
So much so nearly broken
Servants of a lie
Now everything is burning
There's a fire up in the sky
We're up against the fence
When all the walls fall down
Hear the children scream
There where fear abounds
To ask a leading question
From where the money comes?
Who buys the bullets?
Who sells the guns?
In the Garden of Eden
As the wheels go round and round
It's the song of the ages
And the last fair deal's gone down...
